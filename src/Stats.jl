All four fields are `missing` when `views` is empty — no `count_view` survived,

Fraction of rows in `df` matching `condition` (a column-selector pair or vector

Returns `(; ratio, matched, total)`. An empty `df` yields a `ratio` of `0.0`
rather than dividing by zero. That `0.0` is indistinguishable from a genuine
"none of the rows matched", so callers that need to tell "0% of nothing"

ratio.

Whether a length-vs-slope correlation is undefined over `chapters`: fewer than two

Pearson correlation (via `Statistics.cor`) between `chapter_length` and the

[`chapter_decline_slopes`](@ref)), alongside the per-chapter DataFrame used to
compute it.

Returns `(; pearson, chapters)`. Chapters with a `missing` slope are excluded
from the correlation first (but are still present in `chapters`). `pearson` is
`missing` if fewer than two chapters remain, or if `chapter_length` or `slope`
is constant across all remaining chapters.

    spearman_cor(x, y) -> Union{Float64,Missing}

Spearman rank correlation: Pearson's [`Statistics.cor`](@ref) applied to the
ranks of `x` and `y`. Ranks come from `sortperm(sortperm(·))`, which breaks ties
by original position rather than averaging them (`competerank`-style average
ranks aren't needed for a robustness cross-check, and this avoids a `StatsBase`
dependency).

Being rank-based, it is far less sensitive than Pearson to a handful of extreme
values, so a large Pearson/Spearman gap is itself the tell that the Pearson value
is outlier-driven.

A rank correlation needs at least two pairs to vary, so fewer than two is
`missing`: `cor` would throw on an empty sample and return `NaN` for a single
pair. Two or more pairs always have a defined correlation, because ranking by
`sortperm(sortperm(·))` breaks ties by position and so always yields a
permutation of `1:n`, never a constant vector.

Leverage analysis over the per-chapter DataFrame from
[`chapter_length_decline_correlation`](@ref) (or [`chapter_decline_slopes`](@ref)):
recomputes the length-vs-decline correlation on a subset and reports it alongside
a rank correlation and chapter counts, so a few very long (typically
post-completion side-story) chapters can't define the regression line by
themselves.

Chapters with a `missing` slope are dropped first (the `usable` set). `long`
chapters are those longer than `long_chapter_cutoff` episodes. When
`drop_long_chapters` is `true` the correlations are computed over just the
chapters at or below the cutoff; otherwise over the full `usable` set.

Returns `(; pearson, spearman, usable_n, long_n, scored_n)`. `pearson` and
`spearman` are `missing` when fewer than two chapters are scored or their
`chapter_length` or `slope` is constant (undefined correlation — a rank
correlation over a constant `slope` would only echo the positional
tie-breaking of [`spearman_cor`](@ref), not a real trend).
