    add_chapters!(df; base_fn=chapter_base) -> df

Groups episodes into chapters (단원) and adds two columns, ordered by `episode_no`:

- `chapter_no::Int` — 1-based chapter index; equal for every episode in a chapter.
- `chapter_title::String` — the chapter's base title (per `base_fn`).

Episodes are grouped into maximal *consecutive* runs sharing the same base title,
as computed by `base_fn` (default [`chapter_base`](@ref); pass
[`chapter_base_no_serial`](@ref) for novels titled with a leading global episode
serial instead of chapter numbering, or [`chapter_base_prefix`](@ref) for novels
whose per-episode subtitle changes every episode). The run breaks whenever the base title
changes, so a base title that reappears later (after an intervening chapter)
starts a fresh chapter rather than merging non-adjacent episodes. A `missing`
title forms a base of its own and never merges with a neighbour. An empty frame
gets empty columns.
